## API Rate Limits

The Shopify Admin API has rate limits:

- REST Admin API: 40 requests per app per store per minute
- The app handles pagination automatically to stay within limits

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:

- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid credentials
- API rate limiting
- Missing products

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your access token secure
- Regularly rotate your access tokens
- Only grant necessary permissions to your private app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**: Verify your shop name and access token
2. **No Products Found**: Check if your store has products and the app has proper permissions
3. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: The app will handle this automatically, but you may need to wait

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check your Shopify app permissions
2. Verify your store URL and credentials
3. Ensure your products are published and active
